# üìä Weekly Retail Sales SARIMA Analysis - Enhanced Forecasting Approach

## üîó Reference and Inspiration

This analysis is inspired by and builds upon the methodology presented in the repository: 
**[@parvsirohi/retail-sales-forecasting-sarima](https://github.com/parvsirohi/retail-sales-forecasting-sarima/blob/main/Retail_Sales_Forecasting.ipynb)**

However, our implementation takes a significantly different and enhanced approach by focusing on **weekly temporal granularity** instead of monthly aggregation.

## üîÑ Methodological Evolution: From Monthly to Weekly Analysis

### üìÖ **Original Monthly Approach (Reference)**
The referenced implementation focused on:
- **Monthly sales aggregation** for time series analysis
- **12-month seasonal patterns** identification
- **Basic SARIMA modeling** with limited parameter optimization
- **Traditional forecasting horizon** of 6 months
- **Standard performance evaluation** using MAPE

### üóìÔ∏è **Our Enhanced Weekly Approach**
We evolved the methodology to provide:
- **Weekly sales aggregation** for granular pattern detection
- **Multi-period seasonal analysis** (4, 8, 12, 13, 26, 52-week cycles)
- **Comprehensive ARIMA vs SARIMA comparison** with systematic grid search
- **Advanced forecasting techniques** with 8-week ahead predictions
- **Comprehensive performance metrics** (MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE) with detailed diagnostics

## üéØ **Key Improvements and Findings**

### **1. Enhanced Data Granularity**
- **Monthly Analysis**: ~13 data points (limited statistical power)
- **Weekly Analysis**: ~52+ data points (robust statistical foundation)
- **Result**: Significantly improved model reliability and pattern detection capability

### **2. Superior Pattern Recognition**
- **Monthly Analysis**: Captured broad seasonal trends only
- **Weekly Analysis**: Identified intra-month variations, weekly cycles, and micro-seasonal patterns
- **Result**: More accurate representation of actual retail sales behavior

### **3. Advanced Stationarity Testing**
- **Monthly Analysis**: Basic ADF testing approach
- **Weekly Analysis**: Comprehensive dual-testing (ADF + KPSS) with automated transformation
- **Result**: More rigorous statistical foundation for model validity

### **4. Comprehensive Model Optimization**
- **Monthly Analysis**: Limited parameter exploration
- **Weekly Analysis**: Systematic grid search across multiple ARIMA and SARIMA configurations
- **Result**: Optimal model selection based on multiple criteria (AIC, BIC, forecasting performance)

### **5. Enhanced Performance Evaluation**
- **Monthly Analysis**: MAPE of **72.20%** (significant forecasting error)
- **Weekly Analysis**: Achieved **substantially lower MAPE** through granular modeling
- **Result**: Dramatically improved forecasting accuracy for business decision-making

### **6. Advanced Visualization Suite**
- **Monthly Analysis**: Basic time series plots
- **Weekly Analysis**: Comprehensive dashboard with 12+ visualization types including:
  - Multi-panel diagnostic plots
  - Residual analysis visualizations
  - ACF/PACF correlation plots
  - Seasonal decomposition charts
  - Performance comparison graphics
